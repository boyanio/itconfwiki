# IT Conference Wiki
Developers, testers, designers, CTOs and people employed in the IT sector, in general, attend conferences to improve their skills, to meet people, to exchange ideas. Furthermore, many of these people speak at such conferences themselves. I am a developer myself and I also speak occasionally at different events. This project was initially created to help me find events to attend and speak at. There are already other similar projects, however I find them either rather incomplete or difficult to get an overview of what I am looking for. That is why I decided to create this project. Plus, I think it is fun. If you have any comments or ideas how to make it better, don't hesitate to open an issue. PRs are welcome as well. :-)
